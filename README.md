Dartboard-Cricket-Bot

This was a project worked on during the UVA 2022 HooHacks Competition. The computer bot plays the dart game cricket against a specified number of users and uses a command line program to track the current scores of the game.

At the end of the game, there is a to-scale dartboard which displays all of the throws that the computer made during the game.
